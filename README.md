# PPO-based Autonomous Navigation for Quadcopters
[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%203.0-%23F65314?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

This repository contains an implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for autonomous navigation in a corridor environment with a quadcopter. There are blocks having circular opening for the drone to go through for each 4 meters. The expectation is that the agent navigates through these openings without colliding with blocks. **This project currently runs only on Windows since Unreal environments were packaged for Windows.**

### 🛠️ Libraries & Tools

- [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)
- [OpenAI - Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
- [Microsoft AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim)
- [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/)

## Overview

The training environment has 9 sections with different textures and hole positions. The agent starts at these sections randomly. The starting point of the agent is also random within a specific region in the yz-plane.

### Observation Space

- State is in the form of a RGB image taken by the front camera of the agent.
- Image shape: 50 x 50 x 3

### Action Space

- There are 9 discrete actions.

## Environment setup to run the codes
#️⃣ **1. Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/bilalkabas/PPO-based-Autonomous-Navigation-for-Quadcopters
```

#️⃣ **2. From Anaconda command prompt, create a new conda environment**

I recommend you to use [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual-d) to create a virtual environment.

```
conda create -n ppo_drone python==3.8
```

#️⃣ 3. **Install required libraries**

Inside the main directory of the repo

```
conda activate ppo_drone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#️⃣ 4. **(Optional) Install Pytorch for GPU**

> You must have a CUDA supported NVIDIA GPU.


<details>
<summary>Details for installation</summary>

- [Install CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html)
- [Install Pytorch with the compatible CUDA version](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

For this project, I used CUDA 11.0 and the following conda installation command to install Pytorch:

```
conda install pytorch==1.7.1 torchvision==0.8.2 torchaudio==0.7.2 cudatoolkit=11.0 -c pytorch
```

</details>

#️⃣ **4. Edit `settings.json`**

Content of the settings.json should be as below:

> The `setting.json` file is located at `Documents\AirSim` folder.

```json
{
    "SettingsVersion": 1.2,
    "LocalHostIp": "127.0.0.1",
    "SimMode": "Multirotor",
    "ClockSpeed": 20,
    "ViewMode": "SpringArmChase",
    "Vehicles": {
        "drone0": {
            "VehicleType": "SimpleFlight",
            "X": 0.0,
            "Y": 0.0,
            "Z": 0.0,
            "Yaw": 0.0
        }
    },
    "CameraDefaults": {
        "CaptureSettings": [
            {
                "ImageType": 0,
                "Width": 50,
                "Height": 50,
                "FOV_Degrees": 120
            }
        ]
    }
  }
```

## How to run the training?
Make sure you followed the instructions above to setup the environment.

#️⃣ **1. Download the training environment**

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/bilalkabas/DQN-based-Autonomous-Navigation-for-Quadcopters/releases) and download `TrainEnv.zip`. After downloading completed, extract it.

#️⃣ **2. Now, you can open up environment's executable file and start the training**

So, inside the repository
```
python main.py
```

## How to run the pretrained model?
Make sure you followed the instructions above to setup the environment. To speed up the training, the simulation runs at 20x speed. You may consider to change the `"ClockSpeed"` parameter in `settings.json` to 1.

#️⃣ **1. Download the test environment**

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/bilalkabas/DQN-based-Autonomous-Navigation-for-Quadcopters/releases) and download `TestEnv.zip`. After downloading completed, extract it.


#️⃣ **2. Now, you can open up environment's executable file and run the trained model**

So, inside the repository
```
python policy_run.py
```

## Training results
The trained model in `saved_policy` folder was trained for 280k steps.

## Test results
The test environment has different textures and hole positions than that of the training environment. For 100 episodes, the trained model is able to travel 17.5 m on average and passes through 4 holes on average without any collision. The agent can pass through at most 9 holes in test environment without any collision.
